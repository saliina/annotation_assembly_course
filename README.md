# Gene Assembly and Annotation for Arabidopsis thaliana

This project is part of the assembly and annotation course provided by the Univerity of Bern and the Univeristy of Fribourg. 
We aimed to recreate the results found by Wen-Biao Jiao, and Korbinian Schneeberger in their study "Chromosome-level assemblies of multiple Arabidopsis genomes reveal hotspots of rearrangements with altered evolutionary dynamics." (2020)
